# BonerToken Frontend (React + Vite)

This is the frontend dApp for the BonerToken ERC20 project. It allows users to connect their wallet, transfer tokens, burn tokens, and (if owner) mint, pause, or unpause the contractâ€”all via a modern React interface.

## Features

- Connect wallet (MetaMask)
- View connected account
- Transfer BONER tokens to others
- Burn your BONER tokens
- Owner-only actions: mint, pause, unpause
- Clean, responsive UI

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Contract

- Ensure the deployed contract address and ABI are set in `src/utils/ethereum.js`.
- Copy the ABI from your backend's `artifacts/contracts/BonerToken.sol/BonerToken.json` if needed.

### 3. Run the App

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view the app in your browser.

## Backend / Smart Contract

The smart contract code and deployment instructions are available at: [ERC20-token-server](https://github.com/brainDensed/ERC20-Token)

## Notes

- Make sure you are connected to the same network as the deployed contract (e.g., Sepolia).
- The contract address is public and safe to include in the frontend.
